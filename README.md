Hello! My name is Daniel Taylor.
(Former username: ArchDan)

I am a Sheffield University Graduate with a Masters Degree in Computer Science.
I am using this github as a way to store both personal and university work.
I have a great interest in Machine Learning, Robotics and Human Computer Interaction.

I am experienced using Java, Python, C and C++ with libraries to support all these languages.
I have also got moderate experience creating websites (with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as Ruby) along with minor experience using VBScript and Powershell.
I have growing experience using SQL for databases as well as Unity game engine (c++ and c# are both used with this engine).
