I'm Daniel Taylor

I go to Sheffield University and am studying Computer Science
I am using this github as a way to store personal and university work.

As of now, I have moderate experience using Java and python (with some experience using numpy).
I have also got some experience creating websites (with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as Ruby) as well as minor experience using VBScript and Powershell.
I have growing experience using SQL for databases as well as Unity game engine.
