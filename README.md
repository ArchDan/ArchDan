Hello! My name is Daniel Taylor.
(Former username: ArchDan)

I go to Sheffield University and I am studying a Bachelors in Computer Science.
I am using this github as a way to store both personal and university work.

As of now, I am fairly experienced using Java and python (with some experience using numpy).
I have also got moderate experience creating websites (with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as Ruby) along with minor experience using VBScript and Powershell.
I have growing experience using SQL for databases as well as Unity game engine (c++ and c# are both used with this engine).
